1. Modular arithmetic - you just need to find examples, you don't need to prove anything.

a) Is it true that all odd squares are ≡ 1 (mod 8) ?
Yes it is true. We can give few examples:
3 square = 9. 9 ≡ 1 (mod 8)
5 square = 25. 25 ≡ 1 (mod 8)
9 square = 81. 81 ≡ 1 (mod 8)

b) what about even squares (mod 8) ?
It is then false with even sqaures:
2 square = 4. 4 ≡ 4 (mod 8)
4 square = 16. 16 ≡ 0 (mod 8)

2. What do you understand by

a) O(n)
The complexity is linear, meaning that if the size of the the input (n) doubles, the time taken to solve it also double.

b) O(1)
The time taken to solve the problem is constant. It is not affected by n.

c) O(log n)
It is the logarithmic time complexity, it is more efficient than O(n) but less efficient than O(1).

For a proof size, which of these would you want ?
Best is O(1) because it is the least complex one regardless of n.
